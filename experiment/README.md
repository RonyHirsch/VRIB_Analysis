# Multi-trial Inattentional Blindness in Virtual Reality : Experiment

The experiment was programmed in Unity (version: 2019.4.17f1) to work with HTC VIVE Pro Eye headset and controllers. 
Only the right controller can be used to respond during the experiment (as the user only needs to hold one controller, can hold it in their dominant hand and there is no difference between the controllers).

The experimental stimuli are taken from the IAPS database (Lange, Bradley & Cuthbert, 2008); to access the full database, the following [request form](https://csea.phhp.ufl.edu/media/iapsmessage.html) needs to be filled.

### Running the experiment

To run the experiment, once the VIVE setup is connected, and an initial eye-tracker calibration was performed (via the HTC interface), one needs to click the exe file (MyFirstGame.exe). 
Then, the validation instructions appear. Progressing between screens or making any sort of selection (selecting whether to begin a trial or repeat the validation, selecting a bee at the end of the trial, selecting an answer to the awareness probe, or asking for a clue during a trial) is done by clicking the VIVE controller "Teleport" button (i.e., the largest, round button in the middle of the controller). 
Notably, the "music" folder contains all the music accompanying experimental trials. However, it was added manually, in parallel to the experimental run (meaning, the music is not automatically played when the experiment runs; the experimenter plays the next track only once the participant clicks on "continue to the next trial"). Therefore, to run the experiment, the experimneter watches the participant's view and plays the music in sync with their game.

### Techincal notes
Saving of experimental data is done in between trials; therefore, depending on the quality of the computer the experiment is run on, it might take time between trials to save the information and load the next trial. The processor we used was i9-10900. 
In addition, to ensure the best visual quality and as the visual features are abundant in this environment, we recommend running the expeirment on a computer with a good-quality graphics card. We used RTX 3090 GAMING OC 24GB. 

For any technical question about the experimental paradigm or help with adjusting it to your lab, please contact Rony Hirschhorn.
